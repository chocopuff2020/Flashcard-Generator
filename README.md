#HOW IT WORKS: 
    _ ##BASIC Card## --> ```node game.js basic``` 
                 --> Answer to the prompted messages
                 --> The answers will be saved in basic.txt file
    _ ##CLOZE Card## --> ``` node game.js cloze```
                 --> Answer to the prompted messages 
                 --> If the partial phrase does not include "..." instead of the cloze words --> Throw Error Message
                 --> If everything is filled in the correct format --> Save the answers to cloze.txt file.
