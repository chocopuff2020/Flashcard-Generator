<h1>HOW IT WORKS:</h1> 
    <h2> BASIC Card </h2> --> ```node game.js basic``` <br>
                 --> Answer to the prompted messages <br>
                 --> The answers will be saved in basic.txt file <br>
    <h2>CLOZE Card  </h2> --> ``` node game.js cloze```<br>
                 --> Answer to the prompted messages  <br>
                 --> If the partial phrase does not include "..." instead of the cloze words --> Throw Error Message <br>
                 --> If everything is filled in the correct format --> Save the answers to cloze.txt file.<br>
